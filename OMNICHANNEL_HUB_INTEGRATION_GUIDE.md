## 🔗 **SERVICE-TO-SERVICE INTEGRATION PATTERNS**

### **Integration 1: API Gateway ↔ Omnichannel Hub**

**Campaign Context Sharing:**
```python
# API Gateway sends campaign data to Omnichannel Hub
# Omnichannel Hub enriches customer interactions with campaign context

# In your API Gateway (existing):
async def create_campaign(campaign: CampaignCreate):
    # ... existing campaign creation code ...
    
    # Notify Omnichannel Hub of new campaign
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        await client.post(
            "https://omnichannel-hub-313373223340.us-central1.run.app/campaign/register",
            json={
                "campaign_id": campaign.id,
                "target_channels": campaign.channels,
                "customer_segments": campaign.segments
            }
        )
```

### **Integration 2: Telephony Adapter ↔ Omnichannel Hub**

**Voice Call Context Enhancement:**
```python
# In Telephony Adapter - enhance existing call handling
@app.post("/webhook/call-status")
async def handle_call_status(request: Request):
    # ... existing call handling ...
    
    # Send call context to Omnichannel Hub
    if call_status == "in-progress":
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            await client.post(
                "https://omnichannel-hub-313373223340.us-central1.run.app/voice/call-update",
                json={
                    "call_sid": call_sid,
                    "session_id": session_id,
                    "customer_id": customer_id,
                    "call_context": {
                        "duration": call_duration,
                        "quality_score": audio_quality,
                        "ai_insights": voice_analysis
                    }
                }
            )
```

### **Integration 3: Dialog Orchestrator ↔ Omnichannel Hub**

**AI Response Enhancement:**
```python
# Dialog Orchestrator provides intelligent responses for all channels
# Omnichannel Hub requests context-aware responses

# Enhanced Dialog Orchestrator endpoint
@app.post("/conversation/omnichannel-response")
async def generate_omnichannel_response(request: Dict[str, Any]):
    customer_id = request.get("customer_id")
    session_id = request.get("session_id")
    channel = request.get("channel")
    message = request.get("message")
    omnichannel_context = request.get("context", {})
    
    # Generate channel-optimized AI response
    if channel == "voice":
        response = await generate_voice_optimized_response(message, omnichannel_context)
    elif channel == "video":
        response = await generate_video_optimized_response(message, omnichannel_context)
    elif channel == "chat":
        response = await generate_chat_optimized_response(message, omnichannel_context)
    
    return {"response": response, "confidence": 0.95, "channel_optimized": True}
```
