# 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide - Advanced Features

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **ReferenceError: Cannot access 'getBuiltInTemplates' before initialization**
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem:** The `getBuiltInTemplates` function was being called in `useState` initialization before it was defined.

**Solution:** 
- Changed `useState` to initialize with empty array
- Added `useEffect` to populate templates after component mounts
- Templates now load properly without hoisting errors

## 🚨 Remaining Console Messages (Expected)

### 1. **API 404 Errors**
```
api-gateway-313373223340.us-central1.run.app/dashboard/stats:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404
```
**Status:** ⚠️ Expected (Development Mode)
**Explanation:** These are expected in development as the backend API endpoints don't exist yet. The app gracefully handles these failures.

### 2. **WebSocket Connection Failures**
```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3001/' failed
```
**Status:** ⚠️ Expected (Development Mode)
**Explanation:** Real-time collaboration WebSocket server isn't running. Features work with localStorage fallback.

### 3. **Audio File 404s**
```
success.mp3:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404
error.mp3:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404
```
**Status:** ⚠️ Expected (Missing Assets)
**Explanation:** Notification sound files aren't included. Notifications still work visually.

### 4. **Play() Autoplay Errors**
```
NotAllowedError: play() failed because the user didn't interact with the document first
```
**Status:** ⚠️ Expected (Browser Policy)
**Explanation:** Modern browsers block autoplay. Audio will work after user interaction.
