# Fix: "Disconnected from team workspace" Warning

## 🐛 **Problem**
Annoying warning message "Disconnected from team workspace" constantly appearing in the application.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
- **Location**: FlowDesigner component was trying to establish WebSocket connection for real-time team collaboration
- **Issue**: WebSocket URL (`VITE_WS_URL`) not configured in environment variables
- **Behavior**: WebSocket kept trying to connect to non-existent server, failing, and showing disconnect warnings
- **Frequency**: Every 5 seconds (automatic reconnection attempts)

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Made Real-time Sync Optional**
- **File**: `src/components/FlowDesigner.jsx`
- **Change**: Added check for `VITE_WS_URL` environment variable
- **Logic**: Only attempt WebSocket connection if URL is configured
- **Fallback**: Skip real-time sync gracefully when not available

### **2. Improved Warning Logic**
- **Before**: Always showed "Disconnected" warning on any close event
- **After**: Only show warning if we actually had an established connection
- **Result**: No false warnings for services that aren't configured

### **3. Enhanced Error Handling**
- **File**: `src/lib/contextAPI.js`
- **Change**: Added proper URL validation before WebSocket creation
- **Logic**: Return `null` instead of attempting connection with invalid URL
- **Benefit**: Prevents unnecessary connection attempts and errors

## 🔧 **Technical Changes**

### **FlowDesigner.jsx Changes:**
```javascript
// Before
const ws = contextAPI.setupRealtimeSync({
  onDisconnect: () => {
    showNotification('🔌 Disconnected from team workspace', 'warning');
  }
});

// After  
const wsUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_WS_URL;
if (!wsUrl) {
  console.log('⚠️ WebSocket URL not configured - skipping real-time sync');
  return;
}
const ws = contextAPI.setupRealtimeSync({
  onDisconnect: () => {
    if (realtimeConnection) {
      showNotification('🔌 Disconnected from team workspace', 'warning');
    }
  }
});
```

### **contextAPI.js Changes:**
```javascript
// Before
const wsUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_WS_URL || 'wss://api.vocelio.ai/ws';
const ws = new WebSocket(`${wsUrl}?teamId=${this.teamId}&userId=${this.userId}`);

// After
const wsUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_WS_URL;
if (!wsUrl) {
  console.log('⚠️ WebSocket URL not configured - real-time sync disabled');
  return null;
}
const ws = new WebSocket(`${wsUrl}?teamId=${this.teamId}&userId=${this.userId}`);
```

## 🎯 **Result**

### **✅ Fixed Issues:**
- ❌ No more annoying "Disconnected from team workspace" warnings
- ❌ No more failed WebSocket connection attempts
- ❌ No more 5-second reconnection loops
- ✅ Clean console without WebSocket errors
- ✅ Application still functions perfectly without real-time features

### **🔮 Future-Proof:**
- **When WebSocket service is available**: Simply add `VITE_WS_URL=wss://your-websocket-url` to `.env`
- **Real-time features will activate**: Team collaboration, live updates, etc.
- **Graceful degradation**: App works fine with or without real-time sync

## 📝 **Environment Variable**
To **enable** real-time team collaboration in the future, add to `.env`:
```bash
VITE_WS_URL=wss://api.vocelio.ai/ws
```

To **keep disabled** (current state): Leave `VITE_WS_URL` undefined (recommended for now).

## ✨ **Summary**
The annoying "Disconnected from team workspace" warning is now completely eliminated. The application gracefully handles the absence of WebSocket services and provides a clean user experience without unnecessary error messages.
