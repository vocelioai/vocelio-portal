- Secure EventSource connections

### 🚀 API Endpoints Ready for Backend

The frontend is built to work with these backend endpoints:

```
# Department Management
GET    /api/departments
POST   /api/departments
PUT    /api/departments/{id}
DELETE /api/departments/{id}

# Call Management  
GET    /api/calls/active
POST   /api/calls/transfer
GET    /api/calls/logs

# Real-time Events
GET    /api/calls/{id}/events (EventSource)
GET    /api/calls/events (EventSource)
```

### 📈 Performance Features

#### **Optimization**
- **Efficient Rendering**: React hooks for state management
- **Data Caching**: Minimal API calls with smart refresh
- **Real-time Efficiency**: EventSource for live updates
- **Pagination**: Large datasets handled efficiently

#### **User Experience**
- **Instant Feedback**: Loading states and progress indicators
- **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms and fallbacks
- **Responsive UI**: Fast interactions and smooth transitions

## 🔄 Backend Integration Plan

### **Phase 1**: Extend your existing backend with these endpoints
1. Department CRUD operations (`/api/departments/*`)
2. Active calls listing (`/api/calls/active`)
3. Call transfer functionality (`/api/calls/transfer`)
4. Call logs with filtering (`/api/calls/logs`)
5. EventSource endpoints for real-time updates

### **Phase 2**: Data Structure Alignment
Ensure your backend returns data in the expected format:
- Departments: `{id, name, phone_number, description, color}`
- Active Calls: `{call_id, caller_number, duration, status, agent_id}`
- Call Logs: `{call_id, caller_number, start_time, total_duration, status, transfers[], ai_minutes, transfer_minutes}`

### **Phase 3**: Real-time Events
Implement EventSource endpoints for:
- Individual call state changes
- Active calls list updates
- Transfer completion notifications

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Backend Development**: Implement the API endpoints using your preferred framework
2. **Database Schema**: Create tables for departments, calls, and transfers
3. **Testing**: Test the frontend with your backend implementation
4. **Production Deployment**: Deploy both frontend and backend components

The frontend is complete and ready to work with your backend once you implement the required endpoints! 🚀
