**MONITORING & ANALYTICS:**

1. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Web Vitals tracking with Core Web Vitals
   - Real User Monitoring (RUM) with New Relic or DataDog
   - Error tracking with Sentry integration
   - API performance monitoring and alerting
   - WebSocket connection monitoring
   - User session recording and analysis
   - Performance budgets and thresholds
   - Synthetic monitoring for uptime checks

2. **Business Analytics**:
   - Custom event tracking for user interactions
   - Funnel analysis for feature adoption
   - A/B testing framework integration
   - User behavior analytics with Mixpanel/Amplitude
   - Feature flag management with LaunchDarkly
   - Conversion tracking for business metrics
   - Customer satisfaction measurement
   - Usage analytics and reporting dashboard

**TESTING STRATEGY:**

1. **Testing Framework Setup**:
   - Jest configuration for unit testing
   - React Testing Library for component testing
   - Cypress setup for end-to-end testing
   - Playwright for cross-browser testing
   - MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
   - Testing utilities for Redux and React Query
   - Visual regression testing with Chromatic
   - Accessibility testing with axe-core

2. **Test Coverage Requirements**:
   - Unit tests for all utility functions and hooks
   - Integration tests for API service classes
   - Component tests for UI interactions
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Performance tests for load handling
   - Security tests for vulnerability assessment
   - Accessibility tests for WCAG compliance
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing

**CI/CD PIPELINE:**

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
```yaml
name: Deploy Omnichannel Dashboard
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['app/dashboard/omnichannel/**']

jobs:
  test-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test:omnichannel
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run test:e2e:omnichannel
      
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: |
          docker build -t omnichannel-dashboard .
          docker push ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_URL }}/omnichannel-dashboard:latest
```

2. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Blue-green deployment for zero downtime
   - Feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Database migrations with rollback capability
   - CDN cache invalidation for static assets
   - Health checks and readiness probes
   - Monitoring and alerting setup
   - Rollback procedures and automation
   - Documentation and runbook updates

**DOCUMENTATION & MAINTENANCE:**

1. **Developer Documentation**:
